## Overview

This project provides a Go implementation of the command-line interfaces that can be used both as a standalone Go library and as a Node.js addon. The implementation maintains 100% API compatibility with commander.js while leveraging Go's performance benefits.

## Features

- Full API compatibility with commander.js
- High-performance Go implementation
- Node.js addon support for use in JavaScript projects
- No external dependencies
- Comprehensive test suite
- Detailed documentation

## Development Status

üöß **Core Go Implementation**: Complete but needs integration testing  
üöß **CGO Integration**: Implemented but DLL loading issues on Windows  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Node.js Addon**: Builds successfully but Go functions not fully connected  
üöß **JavaScript Wrapper**: Functional with fallback to JS implementation  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Go Backend Integration**: Partially working - DLL loading needs fixes  
üöß **Testing**: Basic functionality verified, integration tests needed

**Current Issues:**
- Windows DLL loading not working properly
- Go functions not accessible from Node.js addon
- Performance benchmarks not yet validated
- API compatibility not fully tested

## Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: Do not install for production use!**

This package is in beta development and should only be used for testing and development purposes.

### For Development/Testing Only

#### Go Projects (Development)
```bash
# DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
go get github.com/rohitsoni-dev/gocommander
```

#### Node.js Projects (Development)
```bash
# DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
npm install gocommander
```

**Requirements for building from source:**
- Visual Studio with C++ development tools (Windows)
- Go 1.25.3 or higher
- Node.js 24 or higher
- npm 11.3.0 or higher

_Note: The Go DLL integration is currently not working on Windows._

## Usage

### Node.js Usage

```javascript
const { Command, hello, version } = require("gocommander");

// Test Go backend connectivity
console.log("Go backend:", hello());
console.log("Go version:", version());

const program = new Command();
program
  .version("1.0.0")
  .description("My awesome CLI application powered by Go")
  .action(() => {
    console.log("Hello from Go backend!");
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

### Go Backend Integration

The JavaScript interface now directly uses the Go implementation for all operations:

```javascript
const { Command, program, addon } = require("gocommander");

// Create commands that are backed by Go
const app = new Command('myapp');
app
  .description('Powered by Go backend')
  .option('-v, --verbose', 'Verbose output')
  .command('serve', 'Start server')
  .action((args, options) => {
    // This action is processed through the Go backend
    console.log('Server starting with Go performance!');
  });

// All parsing is handled by Go
app.parse(process.argv);
```

## Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Go Implementation**: The core logic written in Go for performance (`src/go/gommander.go`)
2. **CGO Exports**: C-compatible exports for interfacing with other languages
3. **Node.js Addon**: A native Node.js addon that bridges JavaScript and Go (`src/addon.cc`)

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25.3 or higher
- Node.js 24 or higher
- npm 11.3.0 or higher
- Visual Studio with C++ development tools (Windows)
- GCC or Clang (macOS/Linux)
- pnpm 10.18.3

### Build Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Build the Go library: `go build -buildmode=c-archive -o src/gommander.a src/go/gommander.go`
4. Build the Node.js addon: `pnpm run build`

## Examples

See the [examples](./examples/) directory for usage examples.

### Project Boilerplate Generator

A CLI tool for generating project boilerplates:

```bash
# List available templates
node examples/boilerplate-generator.js list

# Generate a new Node.js Express project
node examples/boilerplate-generator.js generate node-express my-api

# Generate a new React app with a custom name
node examples/boilerplate-generator.js generate react-app my-app --name "My React Application"
```

This example demonstrates advanced features like:

- Multiple template support
- Dynamic file generation with placeholder replacement
- Nested directory creation
- Comprehensive error handling

### Todo Manager

A CLI tool for managing todo lists:

```bash
# Add a new todo (note: options must come before arguments)
node examples/todo-manager.js add --priority=high --tags=shopping,urgent "Buy groceries"

# List incomplete todos
node examples/todo-manager.js list

# List all todos including completed ones
node examples/todo-manager.js list --all

# Filter by priority
node examples/todo-manager.js list --priority=high

# Filter by tag
node examples/todo-manager.js list --tag=shopping

# Mark a todo as complete
node examples/todo-manager.js complete 1

# Delete a todo
node examples/todo-manager.js delete 2

# Clear completed todos
node examples/todo-manager.js clear
```

This example demonstrates features like:

- Persistent data storage in JSON format
- Priority levels and tagging system
- Filtering and sorting capabilities
- Data validation and error handling
- Proper handling of command-line argument ordering

## Testing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note: Tests currently run with JavaScript fallback due to Go DLL loading issues.**

```bash
# Run Go tests (when Go integration is fixed)
go test ./src/go/...

# Run JavaScript tests (currently working)
pnpm test

# Run example (uses JavaScript implementation)
node example.js
```

### Test the Current Implementation

```bash
# Test basic functionality (JavaScript fallback)
node test/test.js

# Test advanced features (JavaScript fallback)
node test/advanced-test.js

# Run the example CLI (JavaScript implementation)
node example.js serve ./public --port 8080 --watch
```

**Current Test Status:**
- ‚úÖ JavaScript implementation tests pass
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Go integration tests fail due to DLL loading issues
- üöß Performance tests not yet implemented

## Performance

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note: Performance benchmarks are theoretical and not yet validated in the current beta implementation.**

The Go implementation is designed to provide significant performance improvements over the pure JavaScript version while maintaining API compatibility.
